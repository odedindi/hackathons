# Hack the climate

## LandPro - my first hackathon,hack the climate 2021
this is only the frontend part, that is used to show our preliminar project

a basic yet quite cool react-redux app, using Leaflet library with openstreet and google maps services. 

*[Demo](http://climatehackathon.github.io/home)

### it contains 4 pages:
* home page: 2 tabs (how does it work and inspiration)
* map page: a basic demo to show how a user can choose a polygon and send it to get analyzed
* data table: show a table with example information that returns from our model
* the team: show the team members and their role.

### to start it, pull run yarn install and then yarn start.
